# OCF Chart Styling Guide

This repo contains code for creating charts in the general OCF format, using the OCF colour scheme and font.

For plotly, `pio.templates` is used to set the default chart styling for charts made. This is useful if you are using a notebook to create many charts and want the same base styling applied to each chart without having to rewrite the same styling code each time.
